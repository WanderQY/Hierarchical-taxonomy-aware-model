# Hierarchical-taxonomy-aware and attentional convolutional neural networks for acoustic identification of bird species: An genetics-informed approach
Hierarchical-taxonomy-aware and attentional convolutional neural networks for bird acoustic identification

# Get Started
1. Install Python 3.6, PyTorch 1.9.0.
2. Download data. You can obtain all the trained models from Google Drive. All the datasets are well pre-processed and can be used easily.
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder ./scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results by:
