# Hierarchical-taxonomy-aware and attentional convolutional neural networks for acoustic identification of bird species: A genetics-informed approach
Hierarchical-taxonomy-aware and attentional convolutional neural networks for acoustic identification of bird species

# Get Started
1. Install Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.11.0.
2. Download data. You can obtain all the trained models and subset of acoustic recordings from Google Drive and can be accessed via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rORMGIrZKOCLPsvSj0vsGs2Iu5A4QnJE?usp=sharing. All the datasets are well pre-processed and can be used easily.
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder ./scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results by:
